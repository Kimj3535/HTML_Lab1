		<h2> A Brife History of My Life</h2>
		<p> I was born in Timmins Ontario. I enjoyed growing up in the north. After high school I was 
		not sure what I wanted to take in College. I worked full time in retail for over 10 years and have a lot of 
		good work experience, however I did not want to do what I was doing forever.
		I am happily married for 12 years. 
		My Husband is a strong supporter of my education.</p>


		<h2> Why I Chose This Program</h2>
		<p> I picked this program because <strong>I enjoy solving problems and don't stop till I find a solution.</strong>
		About 16 years ago I did a co-op in computers at my high school and enjoyed it.
		So many things have changed snice then or course.
		I like that in computers there is always something new to learn in your job.
		<em>If there is always something new to learn things will not become redundent.</em>
		Another reason I picked this program is for its co-op program.
